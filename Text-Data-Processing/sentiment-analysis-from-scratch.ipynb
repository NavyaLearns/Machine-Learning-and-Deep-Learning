Each word in the lexicon is associated with a score reflecting the strength of the sentiment it conveys. Additionally, two other key components are included: **negation words** and **intensity modifiers**, which are essential for refining sentiment analysis. Here's a breakdown of the key components and their rationale:\n\n#### 1. **Sentiment Lexicon (`SENTIMENT_LEXICON`)**\n   - **Purpose**: The lexicon is used to assign sentiment scores to words based on their sentiment orientation. Each word is mapped to a score between -5 and +5, where positive values represent positive sentiment, and negative values represent negative sentiment. The magnitude of the score represents the intensity of the sentiment.\n   \n   - **Reasoning**: Using a predefined lexicon helps in determining the overall sentiment of a text based on individual word meanings. By associating words with scores, the algorithm can systematically assess whether the sentiment of a sentence or document is positive, negative, or neutral.\n\n#### 2. **Negation Words (`NEGATION_WORDS`)**\n   - **Purpose**: This set contains words that reverse the sentiment of the words they modify (e.g., \"not,\" \"can't,\" \"won't\").\n   - **Reasoning**: Sentiment analysis models need to account for negations, as they can flip the polarity of a sentiment. For instance, \"not good\" should be interpreted as negative, even if \"good\" is a positive word in the lexicon.\n\n#### 3. **Intensity Modifiers (`INTENSITY_MODIFIERS`)**\n   - **Purpose**: These words alter the intensity of the sentiment of nearby words. Words like \"very\" and \"extremely\" increase the intensity of the sentiment, while words like \"slightly\" and \"barely\" reduce it.\n   - **Reasoning**: Intensity modifiers allow for more nuanced sentiment analysis. For example, \"very good\" implies a stronger positive sentiment than just \"good,\" and \"barely acceptable\" indicates a weak positive sentiment.\n\n#### 4. **Stopwords (`STOPWORDS`)**\n   - **Purpose**: The stopwords list contains common words (e.g., \"and,\" \"the,\" \"is\") that are often removed in natural language processing (NLP) tasks because they don't contribute significantly to sentiment analysis. \n   - **Reasoning**: Removing stopwords helps focus on the words that carry sentiment and meaning, improving the performance of the sentiment analysis. These words are generally neutral and don't help in determining sentiment polarity.\n\n### Importance of Each Component:\n- The **sentiment lexicon** is the core of the sentiment analysis process. It allows for the identification of individual word sentiments.\n- **Negation words** and **intensity modifiers** provide a more sophisticated approach, allowing the model to understand context (e.g., negating a sentiment or intensifying it).\n- **Stopwords** removal ensures that the algorithm focuses on the most meaningful terms, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the sentiment analysis process.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Refined sentiment lexicon with intensity scores\nSENTIMENT_LEXICON = {\n    #

The main tasks in this function include **tokenization**, **handling negations**, **retaining punctuation**, and **removing stopwords**. Let's go through the key components of the function and explain its logic.\n\n\n- **Purpose**: This function takes a review text as input and returns a list of preprocessed tokens. These tokens will be used in sentiment analysis to assess the sentiment of the review.\n  \n#### **Tokenization with Retained Punctuation**\n- **Purpose**: This regular expression breaks the review text into individual tokens (words and punctuation). The pattern `\\b\\w+\\b` captures word boundaries, while `[^\\w\\s]` captures punctuation marks and other non-word characters.\n- **Reasoning**: Retaining punctuation can be helpful in some cases, especially when dealing with exclamation marks (which may indicate emphasis or intensity).\n\n#### **Processing Tokens: Main Loop**\nose**: The `processed_tokens` list stores the final tokens after preprocessing. The variables `negate_next` and `double_negation` are used to handle negations in the review text.\n- **Reasoning**: \n  - **`negate_next`**: This flag indicates whether the next word should have its sentiment flipped due to a negation word (e.g., \"not\" or \"can't\").\n  - **`double_negation`**: This flag ensures that double negatives (e.g., \"not bad\" becoming positive) are handled correctly.\n\n#### **Handling Exclamation Marks**\n- **Purpose**: If the token is an exclamation mark (`!`), it is appended to the last token in the `processed_tokens` list. This ensures that the exclamation mark stays attached to the word it follows.\n- **Reasoning**: Exclamation marks often intensify sentiment, so keeping them attached to the word is crucial for preserving context (e.g., \"great!\" vs. \"great\").\n\n#### **Handling Negations**\n- **Purpose**: If a token is a negation word (e.g., \"not,\" \"never\"), the flag `negate_next` is set to `True`, signaling that the next word should have its sentiment flipped. \n- **Double Negation Handling**: If a negation word follows another negation, the `double_negation` flag is set to `True` and the effect of the first negation is canceled out.\n- **Reasoning**: Negations modify the sentiment of the subsequent words, so we need to track their occurrence to modify sentiment accordingly.\n\n#### **Handling Tokens After a Negation Word**\n- **Purpose**: If the current token follows a negation word (`negate_next` is `True`), the sentiment of the token is adjusted:\n  - If double negation occurs, the first negation is removed, and the token is kept positive.\n  - Otherwise, the negation is appended to the token (e.g., \"not good\" becomes \"good_neg_not\").\n- **Reasoning**: This step ensures that the sentiment of the token is properly modified by any negation.\n\n#### **Handling Intensity Modifiers and Stopwords**\n- **Purpose**: \n  - If the token is an intensity modifier (e.g., \"very,\" \"extremely\"), it is added to the `processed_tokens` list, since intensity is important for modifying sentiment strength.\n  - If the token is a stopword (common function word like \"the,\" \"is,\" etc.), it is removed from the review, unless it is a negation word.\n- **Reasoning**: \n  - **Intensity modifiers** help convey the strength of the sentiment, and therefore need to be preserved.\n  - **Stopwords** don't contribute significant meaning to the sentiment analysis, so they are removed. However, negations need to be retained, as they change sentiment meaning.\n\n#### **Return Processed Tokens**\n- **Purpose**: Finally, the function returns the list of preprocessed tokens that will be used for sentiment analysis.\n- **Reasoning**: These tokens now represent the review in a structured way, accounting for negations, intensity, and stopwords.\n\n### Why This Preprocessing is Necessary:\n- **Tokenization**: This is the first step in breaking down a review into manageable pieces for sentiment analysis.\n- **Negation Handling**: Words like \"not\" and \"never\" significantly alter sentiment, and correctly handling them is crucial for accurate analysis.\n- **Intensity Modifiers**: Sentiment strength is key in determining the overall sentiment of a review, and modifiers help reflect the intensity (e.g., \"very good\" vs. \"good\").\n- **Stopword Removal**: Stopwords are generally irrelevant for sentiment analysis, so removing them improves efficiency without losing key sentiment-related information.\n\nThis function is essential for preparing the review text before analyzing the sentiment, ensuring that the model can focus on meaningful tokens and accurately assess the sentiment expressed.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import re\n\ndef preprocess_review(review):\n    \"\"\"Preprocess a review by tokenizing, handling negations, retaining punctuation, and removing stopwords.\"\"\"\n    tokens = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b|[^\\w\\s]', review)  # Tokenize text, including punctuation\n    processed_tokens = []\n    negate_next = False\n    double_negation = False\n    \n    for token in tokens:\n        # Handle exclamation marks\n        if token == '!':\n            if processed_tokens:\n                processed_tokens[-1] += '!'  # Attach exclamation mark to the previous word\n            continue\n        \n        # Handle negations\n        if token.lower() in NEGATION_WORDS:\n            if negate_next:  # Double negation cancels out\n                double_negation = True\n                negate_next = False\n            else:\n                negate_next = True\n            processed_tokens.append(token.lower())\n        elif negate_next:\n            if double_negation:  # Double negation cancels out\n                processed_tokens.pop()  # Remove the first negation\n                processed_tokens.append(token.lower())  # Keep the word as positive\n                double_negation = False\n            else:\n                processed_tokens.append(f\"{processed_tokens.pop()}_neg_{token.lower()}\")\n                negate_next = False\n        else:\n            # Check for intensity modifiers (preserved during stopword removal)\n            if token.lower() in INTENSITY_MODIFIERS:\n                processed_tokens.append(token.lower())\n            # Remove stopwords unless they are negation words\n            elif token.lower() not in STOPWORDS or token.lower() in NEGATION_WORDS:\n                processed_tokens.append(token.lower())\n    \n    return processed_tokens","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-10T15:34:20.970375Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-10T15:34:20.971130Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-10T15:34:20.978826Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-10T15:34:20.971099Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-10T15:34:20.977724Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Explanation for the `calculate_sentiment_scores` Function\n\nThis function calculates **sentiment scores** for a review based on its tokens. The sentiment scores are broken down into:\n- **Positive score**\n- **Negative score**\n- **Neutral score**\n- **Compound score**\n\nIt processes the tokens to determine the sentiment by considering both the individual word sentiment values from the lexicon and the context provided by negations, intensity modifiers, and punctuation. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the function works:\n\n#### **Function Overview**\n- **Purpose**: The function takes a list of tokens (preprocessed review words) and calculates sentiment scores based on the sentiment lexicon, context, and intensity of the words.\n\n#### **Check for Negation**\n- **Purpose**: If a token contains the \"_neg_\" suffix (indicating it was negated), the function retrieves the sentiment value of the base word (the word without the negation) from the `SENTIMENT_LEXICON` and flips its polarity (multiplies by -1).\n- **Reasoning**: Negations change the sentiment of the following word (e.g., \"not good\" becomes negative), so we account for this by inverting the sentiment score.\n\n#### **Retrieve Sentiment Value from Lexicon**\n- **Purpose**: If no negation is present, the function retrieves the sentiment value of the token directly from the `SENTIMENT_LEXICON`.\n- **Reasoning**: Each word has a pre-defined sentiment value, and this is used to calculate the sentiment score for the review.\n\n#### **Apply Intensity Modifiers**\n- **Purpose**: If the previous token is an intensity modifier (e.g., \"very,\" \"extremely\"), the sentiment value of the current token is multiplied by the modifier’s intensity factor.\n- **Reasoning**: Intensity modifiers increase or decrease the sentiment strength (e.g., \"very good\" should have a stronger positive sentiment than just \"good\").\n\n#### **Handle Exclamation Marks**\n- **Purpose**: If a token contains one or more exclamation marks, the function amplifies the sentiment value based on the number of exclamation marks. Each exclamation mark adds 25% intensity to the sentiment value.\n- **Reasoning**: Exclamation marks indicate heightened emotion or intensity in language (e.g., \"amazing!\" has stronger positive sentiment than \"amazing\"), so they amplify the sentiment score.\n\n#### **Accumulate Sentiment Scores**\n- **Purpose**: If the sentiment value is positive, it is added to the `positive_score`. If negative, it is added to the `negative_score`. In both cases, `meaningful_words` is incremented because the word contributes to the overall sentiment.\n- **Reasoning**: Accumulating positive and negative sentiment values helps in determining the overall sentiment of the review.\n\n#### **Calculate Neutral Score**\n- **Purpose**: Neutral words (words that do not have a clear sentiment) are assigned a small value based on the number of non-meaningful words in the review.\n- **Reasoning**: Words that don't contribute positively or negatively are still present, but they don't affect the overall sentiment significantly. A very small value is assigned to represent neutral sentiment.\n\n#### **Calculate Scaled Positive and Negative Scores**\n- **Purpose**: The positive and negative scores are scaled by the number of meaningful words to give a normalized score (i.e., how much positive or negative sentiment there is per meaningful word).\n- **Reasoning**: This normalization ensures that longer reviews don't unfairly skew the sentiment scores.\n\n#### **Calculate Compound Score**\n- **Purpose**: The compound score represents the overall sentiment of the review on a scale from -1 (most negative) to +1 (most positive). It is calculated by averaging the positive and negative scores.\n- **Reasoning**: The compound score gives a quick overview of the review's sentiment, with negative reviews closer to -1 and positive ones closer to +1.\n\n#### **Normalize Scores to Percentages**\n- **Purpose**: The function normalizes the positive, negative, and neutral sentiment scores to percentages based on the total sentiment score.\n- **Reasoning**: This gives an intuitive understanding of the relative proportion of positive, negative, and neutral sentiment in the review.\n- \n### Why This Function is Necessary:\n- **Sentiment Scoring**: This function is crucial for quantifying the sentiment of the review based on word choices, negations, intensity, and punctuation.\n- **Normalization**: By normalizing the sentiment scores, this function ensures that reviews of different lengths are comparable.\n- **Detailed Sentiment Breakdown**: The function provides both a compound score for the overall sentiment and percentages for positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, giving a comprehensive understanding of the review's tone.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def calculate_sentiment_scores(tokens):\n    \"\"\"Calculate sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral, compound) for a review.\"\"\"\n    positive_score = 0\n    negative_score = 0\n    total_words = len(tokens)\n    meaningful_words = 0\n    \n    i = 0\n    while i < len(tokens):\n        token = tokens[i]\n        sentiment_value = 0\n        \n        # Check for negation\n        if \"_neg_\" in token:\n            base_word = token.split(\"_neg_\")[1]\n            sentiment_value = SENTIMENT_LEXICON.get(base_word, 0)\n            sentiment_value *= -1  # Flip polarity due to negation\n        else:\n            sentiment_value = SENTIMENT_LEXICON.get(token, 0)\n        \n        # Apply intensity modifier\n        if i > 0 and tokens[i - 1] in INTENSITY_MODIFIERS:\n            sentiment_value *= INTENSITY_MODIFIERS[tokens[i - 1]]\n        \n        # Amplify sentiment for exclamation marks\n        if \"!\" in token:\n            base_word = token.replace(\"!\", \"\")\n            sentiment_value = SENTIMENT_LEXICON.get(base_word, 0)\n            sentiment_value *= (1 + 0.25 * token.count(\"!\"))  # Each \"!\" adds 25% intensity\n        \n        if sentiment_value > 0:\n            positive_score += sentiment_value\n            meaningful_words += 1\n        elif sentiment_value < 0:\n            negative_score += sentiment_value\n            meaningful_words += 1\n        \n        i += 1\n    \n    # Neutral words are excluded from meaningful_words\n    neutral_score = 0.0001* max(0, total_words - meaningful_words)\n    \n    # Compound score: Normalize between -1 and +1\n    if meaningful_words > 0:\n        scaled_positive = positive_score / meaningful_words\n        scaled_negative = negative_score / meaningful_words\n    else:\n        scaled_positive = 0\n        scaled_negative = 0\n    \n    compound_score = (scaled_positive + scaled_negative) / 4  # Normalize to [-1, +1]\n    \n    # Normalize scores to percentages\n    total_score = abs(scaled_positive) + abs(scaled_negative) + neutral_score\n    positive_percentage = (abs(scaled_positive) / total_score) * 100 if total_score > 0 else 0\n    negative_percentage = (abs(scaled_negative) / total_score) * 100 if total_score > 0 else 0\n    neutral_percentage = (neutral_score / total_score) * 100 if total_score > 0 else 0\n    \n    return {\n        \"positive\": positive_percentage,\n        \"negative\": negative_percentage,\n        \"neutral\": neutral_percentage,\n        \"compound\": compound_score\n    }","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-10T15:34:21.295693Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-10T15:34:21.296035Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-10T15:34:21.305983Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-10T15:34:21.296015Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-10T15:34:21.304818Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Explanation for `weighted_aggregate_sentiment` and `plot_sentiment_distribution` Functions\n\nThese two functions together perform sentiment aggregation and visualization tasks on a dataset of reviews. Let’s break down each function:\n\n---\n\n### **1. `weighted_aggregate_sentiment` Function**\n\nThis function computes the **weighted aggregate sentiment** across all reviews, with weights based on the number of **likes** and **comments** each review has received.\n\n#### **Function Overview**\n*Purpose**: The function aggregates the sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral) for all reviews in a given DataFrame. It uses the number of **likes** and **comments** as weights to give more importance to reviews with higher engagement.\n- **Input**: A DataFrame (`reviews_df`) where each row contains a review and associated metadata like the number of likes and comments.\n- **Output**: A dictionary containing the **weighted average sentiment scores** (positive, negative, neutral) for the entire dataset.\n\n#### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**\n\n1.. **Iterate through the DataFrame**:\n   - **Purpose**: The function iterates over each review in the DataFrame, calculating a weight for each review based on its **likes** and **comments**. The additional `+1` ensures that reviews without likes or comments still have a non-zero weight.\n   \n2. **Preprocess the Review and Calculate Sentiment**:\n   - **Purpose**: The review text is preprocessed (tokenized, negation handled, etc.) and then the sentiment scores are calculated using the `calculate_sentiment_scores` function (which returns positive, negative, neutral, and compound sentiment scores).\n\n3. **Weight the Sentiment Scores**:\n   - **Purpose**: The positive, negative, and neutral sentiment scores for each review are multiplied by the review's weight (based on likes and comments). These weighted scores are then accumulated.\n\n6. **Compute Weighted Averages**:\n   - **Purpose**: After processing all reviews, the weighted sentiment scores are normalized by dividing by the total weight to get the **average sentiment** for the entire dataset.\n\n\n#### **Why is this Necessary?**\n- **Weighted Sentiment**: This approach ensures that more influential reviews (those with higher engagement like comments and likes) contribute more to the overall sentiment scores. It provides a more accurate reflection of public sentiment, especially when some reviews are more impactful than others.\n- **Normalization**: By using a weighted average, the function accounts for the varying importance of reviews, leading to a more representative sentiment score for the dataset as a whole.\n\n---\n\n### **2. `plot_sentiment_distribution` Function**\n\nThis function visualizes the **sentiment distribution** (positive, negative, neutral) of the dataset using a pie chart.\n\n#### **Function Overview**\n- **Purpose**: This function creates a pie chart to visually represent the distribution of sentiment (positive, negative, and neutral) in the dataset.\n- **Input**: A dictionary (`sentiment_scores`) that contains the sentiment percentages for positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.\n- **Output**: A pie chart that shows the relative proportions of positive, negative, and neutral sentiment.\n\n#### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**\n   - **Purpose**: The labels for the pie chart are set to **Positive**, **Negative**, and **Neutral**, and the sizes of the slices correspond to the sentiment percentages provided in the `sentiment_scores` dictionary. Colors are chosen to differentiate the sentiments clearly.\n\n2. **Create Pie Chart**:\n   - **Purpose**: For better visualization, a pie chart is created to plot the negative, postive and neutral share of reviews\n   \n   \n#### **Why is this Necessary?**\n- **Visualization**: A pie chart is a clear and intuitive way to display the relative proportions of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. It provides a quick overview of the sentiment landscape of the entire dataset.\n- **User-Friendly**: Visualization helps users or stakeholders better understand the sentiment distribution, making it easier to grasp the overall sentiment of a large number of reviews.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary: Why These Functions Are Important**\n1. **`weighted_aggregate_sentiment`**:\n   - Ensures that reviews with higher engagement (more likes and comments) contribute more to the overall sentiment score, providing a more accurate and meaningful sentiment aggregation.\n   \n2. **`plot_sentiment_distribution`**:\n   - Provides a visual representation of the sentiment distribution, making it easier to interpret the sentiment scores and communicate the results effectively.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef weighted_aggregate_sentiment(reviews_df):\n    \"\"\"Aggregate sentiment scores across all reviews with weights for likes and comments.\"\"\"\n    total_weight = 0\n    weighted_positive = 0\n    weighted_negative = 0\n    weighted_neutral = 0\n    \n    for _, row in reviews_df.iterrows():\n        weight = row['likes'] + row['comments'] + 1  # Add 1 to avoid zero weight\n        total_weight += weight\n        \n        tokens = preprocess_review(row['review_text'])\n        scores = calculate_sentiment_scores(tokens)\n        \n        weighted_positive += scores['positive'] * weight\n        weighted_negative += scores['negative'] * weight\n        weighted_neutral += scores['neutral'] * weight\n    \n    # Compute weighted averages\n    overall_positive = weighted_positive / total_weight\n    overall_negative = weighted_negative / total_weight\n    overall_neutral = weighted_neutral / total_weight\n    \n    return {\n        \"positive\": overall_positive,\n        \"negative\": overall_negative,\n        \"neutral\": overall_neutral\n    }\n\ndef plot_sentiment_distribution(sentiment_scores):\n    \"\"\"Plot a pie chart for sentiment distribution.\"\"\"\n    labels = ['Positive', 'Negative', 'Neutral']\n    sizes = [sentiment_scores['positive'], sentiment_scores['negative'], sentiment_scores['neutral']]\n    colors = ['#66bb6a', '#ef5350', '#9e9e9e']\n    \n    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\n    plt.pie(sizes, labels=labels, colors=colors, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90)\n    plt.title('Sentiment Distribution')\n    plt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures the pie chart is circular.\n    plt.show()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-10T15:34:21.595704Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-10T15:34:21.596013Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-10T15:34:21.604423Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-10T15:34:21.595991Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-10T15:34:21.603419Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Explanation for `analyze_book_reviews` Function\n\nThis function acts as the **entry point** to analyze the sentiment of **book reviews** from a URL (typically a Goodreads page or another review platform).
